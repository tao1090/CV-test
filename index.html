            <h2 class="title2">APPEARANCE</h2>
            <p>Star Platinum is a humanoid Stand, resembling a tall, well-built man of similar proportions to Jotaro, if not more muscular. In colored art, its skin is often a hue between purple, blue, green, and small bits of gold. Its face and body have varying colors.<br><br>It has long, flowing hair with a darker shade above its eyes and on the bridgeÂ of its nose, blurring the distinction between its hair and head. The spaces under its eyes and on its cheeks and chin are a darker color and divided clearly from the space around its nose and mouth. It wears a cap on its chin, and a metallic headband in three pieces, the central piece of which is shaped as a vertical ellipse. Initially, its facial features were very similar to Jotaro's.<br><br>A wavy line runs from each arm to the front of its torso, continuing down its legs. It has a minimal range of clothing and armor, including a short, circular scarf, shoulder pads with a spiral design, long gloves with studs on the back, knee and elbow guards, a loincloth, and short boots (which became knee-length as of Part 6).Earlier depictions in the manga had Star Platinum wearing pants underneath its loincloth, and the Stardust Crusaders OVA keeps this design aspect throughout.</p>

            <h2 class="title3">PERSONALITY</h2>
            <p>Despite not having a consciousness of its own, Jotaro has described Star Platinum as very violent. It is silent, except when it throws punches, during which it cries "ORAORAORA!" loudly and repeatedly. With a relatively human face, it may show hints of emotion by scowling and smiling.<br><br>Star Platinum does demonstrate a sense of self-preservation, as seen when it halts a bullet Jotaro experimentally shoots at his own head,protects an incapacitated Jotaro from DIO's attacks during Time Stop, and revives him from near-death by directly pumping his heart (however, considering Star Platinum's pioneering role in the series, this capacity may speak primarily to the metaphysical or subconscious qualities of Stand users).<br><br>In the original manga, Star Platinum, early on, is seen with a wide, disconcerting smile. Later on, Star Platinum gains Jotaro's stoic visage, with its future grins only serving to warn the unlucky target of Jotaro's rage that they are about to experience an unimaginable amount of pain.<br><br>Star Platinum is named after the seventeenth Tarot Card, The Star, which symbolizes optimism, discernment, and hope.
